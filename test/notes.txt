P.24 7.4.1.2 SystemTableObjects parameter
    1 System table index.
    2 Actuator address Highest Byte
    3 Actuator address Middle Byte
    4 Actuator address Lowest Byte
    5-6 Actuator Type (MSBits), Actuator Type (LSBits) – Actuator Sub Type
    7   Bit 0-1 : PowerSave Mode
        Bit 2 : io-Membership
        Bit 3 : RF support
        Bit 6-7 : Actuator Turnaround time.
    8 io-Manufacturer Id
    9 Backbone reference number Highest byte
    10 Backbone reference number Middle byte
    11 Backbone reference number Lowest byte

Normally the only field of interest for the product which interface to the gateway is the
System table index field and Actuator type and sub type field (p.25).

P.104 14 Appendix 2: List of actuator types and their use of Main Parameter and Functional Parameters

Node ID - single device address
Backbone address - address common to all devices connected to the same Powerlink. Is equal to one of the device addresses ... the one managing rf communication !!!

Cmd 36 and 37: is the address sent back with 37 after the address request with 36, the backbone address !!!

Cmd 2a and 2b: 2a is Velux discovery; 2b answer reports:
- 1 CB1
- 2 CB2
- 3-5 Target Node ID
- 6-8 Source Node ID
- 9 CMD
- 10-11 Type/Subtype
- 12-14 Backbone Address
- 15 Manufacturer ID
- 16 Multi info byte
- 17-18 Timestamp ??? (always ffff)
