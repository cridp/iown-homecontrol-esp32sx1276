### **Disclaimer**  
Tool designed for educational and testing purposes, provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. Creators and contributors are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this tool.

_I don't give any support, especially concerning the obsolete 1W part._

### Documentation
This code was intentionally written with all possible details found in the protocol documentation.
- (ie: there's 3 differents CRC, 3 differents AES implementation, all detailled)

- This allows those who have little knowledge of C/CPP to understand the sequence of each command.
All these details require you to carefully read the work of @Velocet to understand this protocol.
There is no magic documentation, there is only personal work to adapt to your own needs. The functional basis for the 1W and 2W is there.

### Usage
Use it like a scanner, do some commands on your real device to identify the corresponding CMDid and address

-> Choose you board before build.

### Brief explanation[^1]:
Use 2 interrupts 
  - if PAYLOAD and RX -> decode the frame [^3]
  - if PAYLOAD and TX_READY -> send the frame, decode it [^3]

### platformio[^2] :
_At first time or when a JSON in data folder is modified:_
  1. build filesystem image
  2. upload filesystem image
     
_After any other changes:_  
  - upload and monitor

[^1]: I use an SX1276. If CC1101/SX1262: Feel free to use the old code (Not checked/garanted)

[^2]: I use Visual Studio Code Insider

[^3]: Decoding can be verbose (RSSI, Timing, ...)
